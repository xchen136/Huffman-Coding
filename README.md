# Huffman-Coding
Using Huffman Coding Algorithm to output a list of Huffman [char code] pairs and a file containing the pre-order traversal of the Huffman binary tree.

Input#1 (argv[1]): A file containing a list of [char prob] pairs where the input probability are integers that has been multiplied by 100. For example, probability of 0.40 will become 40 in the input file. And the input char should be treated as string.

Output#1 (argv[2]): a text file containing the Huffman [char code] pairs
Output#2 (argv[3]): a text file containing the pre-order traversal of the Huffman binary tree
Output#3 (argv[4]): output of debugging results.
